# MKobo Frontend Test.

## First Off:

* I understand from the job description that Mkobo is highly interested in Frontend engineers that are framework agnostic, and can create intuitive UI experiences with or without a javascript.
* Hence, I had converted the provided figma file to code using base HTML5 and CSS(SASS), which I believe i would have done even more faster if using a framework was specified.

### SETUP FOR CSS/SCSS PREPROCESSING

* An easy way to go about this would be to download / clone the project, open it up in your favorite editor, finally fire-up the terminal and follow the following instructions below:

### SETUP FOR RUNNING THE PROJECT

* After installation and running the command above. I would suggest you download the 'Live Server & SASS complier' extensions for your editor (e.g: VSCode). This would be useful to easily launch the app into a development server, rather than having to setup node configurations that complicates th app.
* Run the live server and go to "http://localhost:5500/src/views/Dashboard.html" on your browser to access the app.

### FRAMEWORK-BASED IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT

* Here's a link to a React implementaion of this project: https://github.com/Mod5ied/MKobo-React

#### PS:  This project is not a complete work by the way.
